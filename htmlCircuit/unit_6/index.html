			<h2>Who we are</h2>
			<p>Triptych fitness offers personal training, CrossFit programming and 5K/10K endurance programming using a unique approach to cross-training, fundamentals, weightlifting and gymnastics. If you're familiar with the philosophy of <a href="https://www.crossfit.com">CrossFit.</a> Triptych builds on that approach but offers an approach which takes out the guesswork from warm-up to coooldown.</p>

			    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
			    <img id="philosophy_image" src="images/pillars.png" alt="Philosophy areas" title="training philosophy - triptych pillars">
			    <p class="explanation">
			      There are 3 components to the Triptych philosophy - Nutrition, Training, and Recovery. If any of these areas are not addressed in balance with the others, the results will suffer.

			 <section id="improvement">
			    <h3>Improvement</h3>
			    <img id="improvement_image" src="images/skill_strength_mobility.png" alt="Improvement areas" title="training improvement areas">
			    <p class="explanation">
			      Improvement is based on being able to learn a skill, have the requisite mobility and have adequate strength. If any of these areas are not present, then improvement will stagnate. In each session, we will address the weakest area for each movement, and the results will follow.
